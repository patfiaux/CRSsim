# RELICS-performance
This github account contains code and instructions for simulating CRISPR regulatory screens and assessing performance of different methods used in CRISPR regulatory screens

The simulations mirror the experimental steps by taking the following variables into account:

| Experimental step | Simulated step |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| NA | Size and number of enhancers|
| NA | Strength of enhancer |
